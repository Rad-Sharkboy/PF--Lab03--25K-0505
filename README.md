> **About Me:**  
Iâ€™m a passionate Computer Science student who believes programming is more than just code â€” itâ€™s a way to build ideas into reality.

- Always curious about how computers work under the hood.  
- Love experimenting with **C, Python, VB.NET, and web technologies**.
- Loves to watch youtube videos about **CPU/GPU** manufacturing.
- My ultimate goal ðŸŽ¯ is to grow into a developer who not only writes code, but also creates solutions that **impact people positively**.
- I also value collaboration â€” working with colleagues, sharing knowledge/info, and learning from others mistakes.  
- Currently sharpening my skills through Programming Fundamentals labs & projects by writing clean code and learning algorithms and automation.
